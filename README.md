# Replicating FontAwesome Icon Page

This task project is given by the reputable company Themefisher to replicate the FontAwesome Icon Page. The goal is to create a user-friendly interface that allows users to search for icons, filter by categories, and sort icons in ascending or descending order. Users can also access additional details for each icon.

## Features

- **Search Icon**: Users can search for icons by entering keywords in the search field. If any icons match the search criteria, they will be displayed; otherwise, a "Not Found" message will be shown.

- **Filter by Categories**: Icons can be filtered by categories such as "Free," "Paid," and "Others." Users can click on these category buttons to view icons specific to their selection.

- **Sort Icons**: Users can sort the displayed icons in either ascending or descending order. This sorting can be achieved by clicking on the "Ascending" or "Descending" buttons.

- **View Details**: Users can access more details about a specific icon by clicking on the "Details" button associated with each icon.
